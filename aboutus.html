        <h1>About Us Page</h1>
        <p>Every child, no matter who they are or where they come from, deserves access to education.

            Save the Children, through several state-level programmes and national policy-influencing decisions, has helped educate many children! We address the learning crisis by preparing children and adolescents for life, work, and active citizenship.
            
            Come, join our mission to Educate Every Last Child!
            Over the years, we have faced a multitude of issues but undeterred,
            we have devised several solutions that help us continue sharing the gift of education with underprivileged children.
            
            Here, take a look.</p>
